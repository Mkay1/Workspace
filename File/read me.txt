Hello, if it is either the "Desktop", "Downlaods", "Documents", "Pictures", "Music" or "Videos" folder you want to organize then just type it in the text input section, but if it is a folder inside any of the folders listed then type where it is located first with a "\" then the name of the actually folder you want to organize for example, I want to organize a folder named coding which is located in my desktop folder, I would type "Desktop\coding".
please note: The app is case sensitve, make sure you are using the right case ( "Desktop" and "desktop" are not the same, the first is capitalized while is second is in lower case)
